# Coin Changer

The Coin Changer problem addresses the following question: how can a given amount of money be made with the least number of coins of given denominations?

  - The task I was given was to write a program to take a given amount of money and return it in the least number of coins possible.
  - This was my first endeavor into working through hashes and still early in passing variables back and forth through erb's and rb's.
  - I was able to code the function seperately from the app and require it in the app.
    -  This means that the logic is seperate from the app and the app only includes relevant information to control the user experience.
  - As an homage to my economic nerd friends, I accounted for the Trillion Dollar coin which was proposed during the 2011 US Debt Ceiling Crisis.
